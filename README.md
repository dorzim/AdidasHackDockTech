# AdidasHackDockTech
Making personalized ux with image proccessing and AI.

the user uploads his image and with Unet based network powered by Keras, we strip the users previous item and dress him with the desired item from the website.

The first script (fashion.py) we strip the background from a shirt from adidas catalog.
The second script (instance_segmentation.py) we strip the users image from his original shirt.

in samples directory you can see the images that we used.
in res directory you can see the adidas catalog shirts and in uri directory you can see the users image striped from foreground
